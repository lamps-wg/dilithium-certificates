   <abstract>
      <t>Digital signatures are used within X.509 certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and to sign messages. This document updates the "Algorithms and Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key   Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC 3279] and describes the conventions for using Dilithium quantum-resistant signatures in Internet X.509 certificates and revocation lists.  The conventions for the associated post-quantum signatures, subject public keys, and private key are also described.</t>
    </abstract>

    <note>
    <t>[EDNOTE: This draft is not expected to be finalized before the NIST PQC Project has standardized PQ algorithms. After NIST has standardized its first algorithms, this document will replace TBD, with the appropriate algorithms and parameters before proceeding to ratification. The algorithm Dilithium has been added as an example in this draft, to provide a more detailed illustration of the content - it by no means indicates its inclusion in the final version. This specification will use object identifiers for the new algorithms that are assigned by NIST, and will use placeholders until these are released.]</t>

    <!-- <t>The migration from traditional public-key cryptographic algorithms (such as RSA and ECDSA) to quantum-safe algorithms is often facilitated though a transitional phase in which a hybrid of both types of algorithms are used simultaneously. In PKIX, there are two methodologies for achieving this, i) to utilize “dual certificates” in which one certificate contains traditional digital signature algorithms, and the other a quantum-secure algorithm from the NIST PQC, or ii) “composite certificates” in which a single certificate combines one or more traditional signature algorithms with one or more NIST PQC signature algorithms.</t>
    <t> Current draft <xref target="draft-truskovsky-lamps-pq-hybrid-x509-01" format="default"></xref> specifies a way to achieve composite certificates, whereas this document targets the specification of option (i) “dual certificates”. More specifically, the certificate containing only quantum-secure NIST PQC algorithms (or a PQC algorithm vetted by the CFRG). However, this specification may also be utilized by option (ii) when defining the use of NIST PQC algorithms within the composite certificates.</t> -->

For the purpose of estimating security strength, it has been assumed that the attacker has access to signatures for no more than 2^{64} chosen messages.</t>

      <!--<t>TODO: Add discussion about digests in classical signatures hash-then-sign and how that does not apply to PQ like Dilithium. And how committing to a message is additional security. Reference NIST discussion from Peiker and Makku.</t>-->
      <t>EDNOTE: Discuss implications of not hash-then-sign. Implications in performance too.</t>
      <!-- [JM] Small note on hash-then-sign. Dilithium (see fig 4 line 10 of https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/data/dilithium-specification-round3.pdf) " Our full scheme in Fig. 4 also makes use of basic optimizations such as pre-hashing the message M so as to not rehash it with every signing attempt." -->
      <t>Within the hash-then-sign paradigm, hash functions are used as a domain restrictor over the message to be signed. By pre-hashing, the onus of resistance to existential forgeries becomes heavily reliant on the collision-resistance of the hash function in use. As well as this security goal, the hash-then-sign paradigm also has the ability to improve performance by reducing the size of signed messages. As a corollary, hashing remains mandatory even for short messages and assigns a further computational requirement onto the verifier. This makes the performance of hash-then-sign schemes more consistent, but not necessarily more efficient. Dilithium diverges from the hash-then-sign paradigm by hashing the message during the signing procedure (at the point in which the challenge polynomial). However, due to the fact that Dilithium signatures may require the signing procedure to be repeated several times for a signature to be produced, Dilithium implementations can make use of pre-hashing the message to prevent rehashing with each attempt.</t>

      <t>EDNOTE: Discuss side-channels for Dilithium. .</t>
      <t>Dilithium has been designed with an aim to provide side-channel resilience by eliminating a reliance on Gaussian sampling. While deliberate design decisions such as these can help to deliver a greater ease of secure implementation - particularly against side-channel attacks - it does not necessarily provide resistance to more powerful attacks such as differential power analysis. Some amount of side-channel leakage has been demonstrated in parts of the signing algorithm (specifically the bit-unpacking function), from which a demonstration of key recovery has been made over a large sample of signatures. Masking countermeasures exist for Dilithium<!--[MGTF19]-->, but come with a performance overhead.</t>

      <t>A fundamental security property also associated with digital signatures is non-repudiation. Non-repudiation refers to the assurance that the owner of a signature key pair that was capable of generating an existing signature corresponding to certain data cannot convincingly deny having signed the data. The digital signature scheme Dilithium possess three security properties beyond unforgeability, that are associated with non-repudiation. These are exclusive ownership, message-bound signatures, and non-resignability. These properties are based tightly on the assumed collision resistance of the hash function used (in this case SHAKE-256).

      Exclusive ownership is a property in which a signature sigma uniquely determines the public key and message for which it is valid. Message-bound signatures is the property that a valid signature uniquely determines the message for which it is valid, but not necessarily the public key. Non-resignability is the property in which one cannot produce a valid signature under another key given a signature sigma for some unknown message m. These properties are not provided by classical signature schemes such as DSA or ECDSA, and have led to a variety of attacks such as Duplicate-Signature Key Selection (DSKS) attacks <!--[BWM99, MS04]-->, and attacks on the protocols for secure routing<!--[JCCS19]-->. A full discussion of these properties in Dilithium can be found at <xref target="CDFFJ21" format="default"></xref>.

      These properties are dependent in part, on unambiguous public key serialization. It for this reason the public key structure defined in <xref target="dilithiumpublickey" format="default"/> are intentionally encoded as a single OCTET STRING.</t>

        <t>Instead of defining the strength of a quantum algorithm in a traditional manner using precise estimates of the number of “bits of security,” NIST has instead elected to define a collection of broad security strength categories. Each category is defined by a comparatively easy-to-analyze reference primitive that cover a range of security strengths offered by existing NIST standards in symmetric cryptography, which NIST expects to offer significant resistance to quantum cryptanalysis. These categories describe any attack that breaks the relevant security definition that must require computational resources comparable to or greater than those required for: Level 1 – key search on a block cipher with a 128-bit key (e.g., AES128), Level 2 – collision search on a 256-bit hash function (e.g., SHA256/ SHA3-256), Level 3 – key search on a block cipher with a 192-bit key (e.g., AES192), Level 4 – collision search on a 384-bit hash function (e.g. SHA384/ SHA3-384), Level 5 – key search on a block cipher with a 256-bit key (e.g., AES 256).</t>
      
        <t>The parameter sets defined for NIST security levels 2, 3 and 5 are listed in the Figure 1, along with the resulting public key and private key sizes in bytes.</t>

v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
                     year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the 
                     IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.
