# Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure: Algorithm Identifiers for ML-DSA

This is the working area for the IETF [LAMPS Working Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/lamps/documents/) Internet-Draft, "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure: Algorithm Identifiers for ML-DSA".

NOTE: This I-D previously referred to Dilithium. The I-D has been updated to refer to [FIPS-204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final). The string "dilithium" in the filename is just an artifact of the I-Ds name when it was created before ML-DSA was assigned.
