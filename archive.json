      "body": "- [x] The new title should be something like \"Algorithms and Identifiers for CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure.\u201d \r\n- [x] The document should more clearly identify the version of Dilithium: 3.1. If there are more versions, those would have different identifiers. There has been compatibility-breaking changes after the version submitted as a Finalist to Round 3, which is still on the NIST website (we've had customers try to match our implementation with those v3.0 KATs, requiring explanations). The changes from 3.0 to 3.1 include a security fix (at Level 5), so compatibility with the latest version is important. See Vadim Lyubashevsky's explanation, February 8, 2021: https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/BjfjRMIdnhM/m/W7kkVOFDBAAJ  Note that there were several other internal changes in from 3.0. to 3.1 apart from the hash lengths.\r\n- [ ] A note about the signing process would be helpful; Dilithium 3.1 computes a signature for mu = H2( H1(pk) | M ), where H1 is SHAKE-256 truncated to 32 bytes -- a hash of the public key, also denoted \"tr\" -- and H2 is SHAKE-256 truncated to 64 bytes. The number designation of SHAKE of course indicates security level, not the output length, as SHAKE is an XOF. \r\n- [x] I suggest the document also includes signature sizes for (detached) signatures: 2420, 3293, and 4595 bytes. Currently, only public and private key sizes are reported in Appendix B of the I-D. \r\n- [ ] The secret key lengths in Appendix B match with v3.1 (v3.0 has 16 bytes longer private keys), but do not account for ASN.1 encoding of the SEQUENCE in Section 5 of the same I-D. Even section 5 itself does not seem to account for this as it reports \"the size necessary to hold all private key elements.\" There is a de facto key transport encoding for secret keys, defined by the algorithm designers and used in KAT tests, that doesn't have ASN.1 encoding of individual components. It can be simply taken as an OCTET STRING, just like the public key in this I-D. The lengths in Appendix B match that encoding, not the completely new encoding in Section 5.\r\n- [x] ~~Section 5 states \"The randomized version can be invoked by leaving K as EMPTY.\" Private key formats are determined by application requirements and should not be used as \"APIs\" to affect functionality as suggested. Side-channel secure implementations will only use this type of plaintext ASN.1 encoding for backup/transport (never actively) and are likely to always perform randomized signing. Some other implementations (perhaps without trustworthy RNGs) may always perform deterministic signing; this does not break the interoperability of signatures. The explanation for the \"tr\" field in that private key format is not accurate (see above).~~ Created [new issue](https://github.com/lamps-wg/dilithium-certificates/issues/6) for this.\r\n",

Hash-then-sign also gives performance and bandwidth benefits, for example, when the signature is performed by a networked cryptographic appliance since you only need to send a small hash value rather than streaming the entire message.\r\n> \r\n> With Dilithium and Falcon signatures it is not recommended to pre-hash for the following reasons:\r\n> \r\n> The Dilithium construction includes\r\n> \r\n> ~~~\r\n> Sign(sk,M):\r\n> 10: mu \\in {0, 1}^384 := CRH(tr || M)\r\n> ~~~\r\n> \r\n> where `CRH` is any collision-resistant hash function and `tr` is a component of the secret key.

This provides strong security against pre-computed collision attacks since an attacker has no a-priori knowledge of `r` and provides per-signature hash-domain separation of the message to be signed.\r\n> \r\n> If the message to be signed is pre-hashed, for example `m0 = SHA256(m)` and then m0 provided to Dilithium or Falcon to sign, then you have re-introduced the collision problem since two messages m1 and m2 where SHA256(m1) == SHA256(m2) hash value will result a single Falcon or Dilithium signature value which is simultaneously valid for both m1 and m2. This removes the extra collision resistance built in to the Dilithium and Falcon primitives and reduces it to the collision resistance strength of the underlying hash function. For this reason it is in general not recommended to pre-hash when using Dilithium or Falcon except in cases where the implementor is comfortable with this reduction in security.\r\n> \r\n> Therefore, for the purpose of interoperability of composite signatures, implementations MUST NOT pre-hash messages for Dilithium and Falcon. If pre-hashed versions of these signatures are desired, then separate signature algorithms will need to be defined.\r\n> \r\n> Third, I can imagine that some applications (like TLS) will want to use non-pre-hashed versions of Dilithium and Falcon, but other applications (like code-signing) would prefer pre-hashed versions.

In fact, some implementors may choose to use the random seed K in a different way; additionally binding it in a hash with some RNG output, the public key, a device-intrinsic key, or whatever. This would often be sensible from security viewpoint. The K value is merely used to randomize the signing process.

That was done to optimize public key size by omitting `t0`. `t0` is used when signing and is only stored in the private key to optimize space.\r\n\r\nSomeone can derive the public key `(rho, t1)` from the private key `rho, K , tr, s1, s2 , t0` by performing the `t := A*s1+s2` computation and getting `t1` from `(t1, t0) := Power2Roundq(t, d)`. `t := A*s1+s2` is almost as expensive as key generation itself. \r\n\r\nIn other words, not including the public key `(rho, t1)` in the private key ASN.1 structure will require a signer that has the private key only to do a `t := A*s1+s2` operation in order to get the public key `(rho, t1)`.

Secure, non-volatile key storage is very expensive in hardware devices, and the 256-bit Dilithium seed can be internally managed exactly like an AES key. We have semiconductor customers that want this due to the storage issue, despite the performance penalty. However, such keys are managed without any ASN.1 encodings and hence are not really of interest to LAMPS.\r\n> \r\n> Clearly, converting a standard-format Dilithium key back to the seed is impossible.

So.. we happen to have side-channel protected determinstic Dilithium key generation even though an analogous RSA signature module would not  have it. This is because signature key generation is performed \"rarely\" (perhaps only once, during device enrollment) and is randomized. Others may choose not to implement signature algorithm key generation in such a manner.\r\n\r\nAnd Bas acknowledged \r\n>> With side-channel protections, it is a completely different matter due to the random sampling required in key generation.  Side-channel attacks generally require many traces of the same operation to be effective; if key generation is only performed only once, it is less vulnerable. But if key generation is performed for every signature, as proposed, then it needs the same level of protection.\r\n\r\n> This is a good argument against.\r\n\r\n",

It is true that the signing procedure may need to be repeated several times, but the message is only hashed once.\r\n\r\nThe signing algorithm can be found in Algorithm 2 of https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.204.ipd.pdf. The message is only used once (on line 6) to create a message representative (\u03bc \u2190 H(_tr_ || _M_, 512)). Starting on line 11, a loop is run until a signature is successfully created. But, within this loop the message representative \u03bc is used rather than _M_. So, pre-hashing is not needed to prevent the message from being rehashed with each attempt.\r\n\r\nWhere ML-DSA differs from the traditional hash-then-sign paradigm is that the message is hashed as \u03bc \u2190 H(_tr_ || _M_, 512), where _tr_ is the hash of the public key, rather than just as \u03bc \u2190 H(_M_, 512).",

One good reason for this is backwards-compatibility with signature primitives that do not have ctx params (ie if we want to use the same context string across all signature schemes, then this is the only option), and even compatibility with crypto libraries that offer ML-DSA but no not have a `.Sign()` interface that accepts a ctx parameter.\r\n\r\nEmpty string is already the default in FIPS 204, so in theory nothing needs to be said in draft-dilithium-certificates, but it would probably be polite to put in a sentence.",

And even if it was, it means SLH-DSA would need to something else, which means less alignment. \r\n\r\nAnyway, if the WG concludes that taking mu is preferred than HashML-DSA, then I can live with it. In a sense it solves my problem.
