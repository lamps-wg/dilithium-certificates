      "body": "- [x] The new title should be something like \"Algorithms and Identifiers for CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure.\u201d \r\n- [x] The document should more clearly identify the version of Dilithium: 3.1. If there are more versions, those would have different identifiers. There has been compatibility-breaking changes after the version submitted as a Finalist to Round 3, which is still on the NIST website (we've had customers try to match our implementation with those v3.0 KATs, requiring explanations). The changes from 3.0 to 3.1 include a security fix (at Level 5), so compatibility with the latest version is important. See Vadim Lyubashevsky's explanation, February 8, 2021: https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/BjfjRMIdnhM/m/W7kkVOFDBAAJ  Note that there were several other internal changes in from 3.0. to 3.1 apart from the hash lengths.\r\n- [ ] A note about the signing process would be helpful; Dilithium 3.1 computes a signature for mu = H2( H1(pk) | M ), where H1 is SHAKE-256 truncated to 32 bytes -- a hash of the public key, also denoted \"tr\" -- and H2 is SHAKE-256 truncated to 64 bytes. The number designation of SHAKE of course indicates security level, not the output length, as SHAKE is an XOF. \r\n- [x] I suggest the document also includes signature sizes for (detached) signatures: 2420, 3293, and 4595 bytes. Currently, only public and private key sizes are reported in Appendix B of the I-D. \r\n- [x] ~~The secret key lengths in Appendix B match with v3.1 (v3.0 has 16 bytes longer private keys), but do not account for ASN.1 encoding of the SEQUENCE in Section 5 of the same I-D. Even section 5 itself does not seem to account for this as it reports \"the size necessary to hold all private key elements.\" There is a de facto key transport encoding for secret keys, defined by the algorithm designers and used in KAT tests, that doesn't have ASN.1 encoding of individual components. It can be simply taken as an OCTET STRING, just like the public key in this I-D. The lengths in Appendix B match that encoding, not the completely new encoding in Section 5.~~ Addressed in https://github.com/lamps-wg/dilithium-certificates/pull/61\r\n- [x] ~~Section 5 states \"The randomized version can be invoked by leaving K as EMPTY.\" Private key formats are determined by application requirements and should not be used as \"APIs\" to affect functionality as suggested. Side-channel secure implementations will only use this type of plaintext ASN.1 encoding for backup/transport (never actively) and are likely to always perform randomized signing. Some other implementations (perhaps without trustworthy RNGs) may always perform deterministic signing; this does not break the interoperability of signatures. The explanation for the \"tr\" field in that private key format is not accurate (see above).~~ Created [new issue](https://github.com/lamps-wg/dilithium-certificates/issues/6) for this.\r\n",

Assuming our understanding below is correct, a direct-sign algorithm would require the entire thing to be streamed to a network HSM for signing and to a TPM for verification. Conversely code-signing environments often include counter-signatures from Time Stamping Authorities which protect against future discovery of collision attacks against the hash function -- as an example, Windows still accepts RSA-SHA1 signatures produced before SHA1 was deprecated.

That isn't applied to the input message.\r\n>In any case, it's easy to derive SHAKE( M || 1 ), SHAKE( M || 2 ), ... without multiple passes through M; you compute the partial SHAKE state after process M, and then apply that partial state to 1, 2, ...\r\n\r\nI think we are referring to different parts of the signing process here. For reference, my security consideration was referring to page 4 of the Dilithium spec that states:\r\n\"Our full scheme in Fig. 4 also makes use of basic optimizations such as pre-hashing the message M so as to not rehash it with every signing attempt.\" and Figure 4 itself.\r\n\r\nIt was my understanding that the signing procedure may need to be repeated several times to produce a signature, and thus pre-hashing would prevent the need to individually hash the input message with each attempt. I believe the desired differing of the hash you mentioned is within the internals of the signing procedure and not on the input message itself.\r\n\r\n   >> Third, I can imagine that some applications (like TLS) will want to use non-pre-hashed versions of Dilithium and Falcon, but other applications (like code-signing) would prefer pre-hashed versions. These are not interoperable with each other. Is NIST planning to produce algorithm definitions, OIDs, Codepoints, etc, for both versions?\r\n\r\n   >Expanding on the code-signing example: the messages to be signed can be very large; consider a several GB firmware image. Assuming our understanding below is correct, a direct-sign algorithm would require the entire thing to be streamed to a network HSM for signing and to a TPM for verification. Conversely code-signing environments often include counter-signatures from Time Stamping Authorities which protect against future discovery of collision attacks against the hash function -- as an example, Windows still accepts RSA-SHA1 signatures produced before SHA1 was deprecated. I can imagine that the code-signing community will decide that the performance gains of hash-then-sign outweigh the security loss.\r\n\r\n>So, will NIST standardize both direct-sign and some variant of hash-then-sign for PQC signature primitives?\r\n\r\nI do agree that there may be optimizations that users may wish to make dependent on the context, i.e., hash-then-sign vs direct-sign. It's for this reason I tried to give an overview of the security of each option in the draft, but ultimately leave that up to the user. It is a good point regarding NISTs perspective on what should be explicitly standardized here.\r\n\r\n>> This provides strong security against pre-computed\r\n>> collision attacks since an attacker has no a-priori knowledge of `r` and\r\n>> provides per-key hash-domain separation of the message to be signed.\r\n>\r\n>Rather, it limits the usability of any found collision to a specific public key; however it does nothing to frustrate a collision attack against a specific public key.\r\n\r\nRight, more details on the advantages of message binding on the PQC-forum from C. Peikert's https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/eAaiJO1qzkA/m/K66R_ftNBwAJ. It was this discussion I was trying to encompass in the draft.",

In terms of public key material, only `rho`, `tr=CRH(rho|| t1)` and `t0` are included in the private key, but not the `t1` part of the whole t (`t=(t0,t1)`). `t0, t1` are non-sensitive and they make the whole t value which could be looked as a public key. `t1` is only included in the Dilithium public key  `(rho, t1)` and is used for verification. That was done to optimize public key size by omitting `t0`. `t0` is used when signing and is only stored in the private key to optimize space.\r\n\r\nSomeone can derive the public key `(rho, t1)` from the private key `rho, K , tr, s1, s2 , t0` by performing the `t := A*s1+s2` computation and getting `t1` from `(t1, t0) := Power2Roundq(t, d)`. `t := A*s1+s2` is almost as expensive as key generation itself. \r\n\r\nIn other words, not including the public key `(rho, t1)` in the private key ASN.1 structure will require a signer that has the private key only to do a `t := A*s1+s2` operation in order to get the public key `(rho, t1)`. Given that signers usually do not use the public key to verify their own signatures and that the `A*s1+s2` is not awfully expensive, it seems that not putting the whole public key in the private key structure is justified to keep the private key size smaller, prevent issues of the past by putting optional parameters. \r\n\r\nI would expect signers to have a separate copy of their public key `(rho, t1)` and not only store their private key anyway. PKCS#8 could also take either of these in it. Additionally, the private and public key structures should just follow the Signature algorithm specification from NIST and not introduce additional structures that are unnecessary as David B. suggestion above.

Secure, non-volatile key storage is very expensive in hardware devices, and the 256-bit Dilithium seed can be internally managed exactly like an AES key. We have semiconductor customers that want this due to the storage issue, despite the performance penalty. However, such keys are managed without any ASN.1 encodings and hence are not really of interest to LAMPS.\r\n> \r\n> Clearly, converting a standard-format Dilithium key back to the seed is impossible. So you can't export the seed from an implementation that uses standard-format keys.\r\n> \r\n> There is a performance penalty from using the seed, but indeed it is not horribly high on a non-protected implementation (if you completely merge the key generation with signing in the implementation) -- I'd guess ~20%?\r\n> \r\n> With side-channel protections, it is a completely different matter due to the random sampling required in key generation.  Side-channel attacks generally require many traces of the same operation to be effective; if key generation is only performed only once, it is less vulnerable. But if key generation is performed for every signature, as proposed, then it needs the same level of protection.\r\n> \r\n> The sampling is uniform in a small range, but masked rejection sampling involves masked comparisons and a \"gather\" operation which are quite expensive. I'd guess the cost is 50%, but customers still want this as otherwise they would need tens of kilobytes of non-volatile storage inside the on-chip security boundary. So.. we happen to have side-channel protected determinstic Dilithium key generation even though an analogous RSA signature module would not  have it. This is because signature key generation is performed \"rarely\" (perhaps only once, during device enrollment) and is randomized. Others may choose not to implement signature algorithm key generation in such a manner.\r\n\r\nAnd Bas acknowledged \r\n>> With side-channel protections, it is a completely different matter due to the random sampling required in key generation.

It is true that the signing procedure may need to be repeated several times, but the message is only hashed once.\r\n\r\nThe signing algorithm can be found in Algorithm 2 of https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.204.ipd.pdf. The message is only used once (on line 6) to create a message representative (\u03bc \u2190 H(_tr_ || _M_, 512)). Starting on line 11, a loop is run until a signature is successfully created. But, within this loop the message representative \u03bc is used rather than _M_. So, pre-hashing is not needed to prevent the message from being rehashed with each attempt.\r\n\r\nWhere ML-DSA differs from the traditional hash-then-sign paradigm is that the message is hashed as \u03bc \u2190 H(_tr_ || _M_, 512), where _tr_ is the hash of the public key, rather than just as \u03bc \u2190 H(_M_, 512).",

You can only control it for PureXX-DSA. \r\n\r\nI meant that ctx did not exist in Dilithium. It was introduced for the M' calculation when NIST added the HashML-DSA option. I think the idea for ctx and domain separation came from Markku when discussing the EUF-CMA property of the newly introduced HashML-DSA and PureML-DSA. I am fuzzy on the details. Now that we will basically not be using HashML-DSA, I don't think we should care about the option. \r\n\r\nI think Sophie had made a few good points against the necessity of ctx in ML-DSA as well, but there are too many things to track and I forget the details. \r\n\r\nI don't have any strong feelings about ctx in SLH-DSA. Given that you will need Pure and Hash there (you can't do external my like ML-DSA), maybe you want to use ctx as `PR-PKIX` and `DG-PKIX` and call it a day. Or maybe you can use empty string for the Pure and specify `HashSL-DSA-PKIX` only for the external generation of M' in the HashSLH-DSA. I really don't have strong feelings, but it seems to me of HashXX-DSA is really used, adding the context makes sense.",

I suggest to remove it. You can fool the signer that generates tr to use a different public key, but then you would also need to fool the rest of the signing to use a different private key. It means you control the whole signature generation which means you can do anything. \r\n\r\nThe next sentence is fine though. tr should be generated with a public key we can trust regardless of how it is to exploit it.
